## Use Case Abstract

Mark received a notification from his insurance company informing him that new covers have been added to his policy. He is excited to know more about the new covers, but he is also concerned that he might not be able to understand the information properly due to his cognitive disability.

Mark decides to contact the insurance company and request for the new policy documents to be explained to him in a simple and clear manner. The customer service representative understands Mark's needs and sends him the link to ComprehendNow so that he can find what he needs in the policy document in simplified language and with clear explanations of the new covers.

Mark is relieved to find that he can easily understand the information and can access it at any time he wants, even from his favorite messaging app. He is also pleased that he can easily ask questions on the policy document if he has any questions or needs clarification.
