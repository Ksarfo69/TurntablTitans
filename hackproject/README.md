## Introduction

Our NLP chatbot solution aims to help people with disabilities understand complex documents by providing them with a simplified and easily understandable version of the document. This solution is built using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and process the document text.

The chatbot interface allows users to interact with the system using natural language commands, and the system responds with a summary of the document or answers to the user's questions.

## Features

- Supports multiple document formats, including PDF, .docx, and plain text files.
- Uses natural language processing to understand user queries and provide relevant information.
- Provides a summary of the document content in an easily understandable format.
- Allows for questions on document content.
